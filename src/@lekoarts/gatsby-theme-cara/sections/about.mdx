## About Me

Hi. I am a MERN Stack developer (Fresher),from Ghaziabad, I have done my master Degree in Computer Application.

It all started in 2020 where I first learnt to build static landing pages.
Then I came to know about how servers work with the help of Python,Java and now currently Node.js.
That expanded my view upon the possibilities of creating huge applications

Then I slowly started engaging myself building single page application development Using React,
state management techniques using Redux.js and Context API and sideeffects using Redux-thunk
and Redux-Saga,Node.js and Express.js and knowing how to connect to databases using MongoDB.
